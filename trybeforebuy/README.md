I put the most recent deb here for users who want to "try before buying." Whether it be that you can't afford the tweak, don't have the means to pay, or really do want to give it a test run before buying (I know I usually do), then feel free to download and install the deb from here. This deb should be up to date most of the time. I guess it's better that you get it from me than from pirate repos.

The downside to getting it this way is you don't get the automatic updates, you'll have to do it manually. If you can buy it, and want it, then please buy it. I worked hard on this tweak, and I'd really appreciate it :)

You can download the deb from [here](/trybeforebuy/org.thebigboss.snooscreens_1.1_iphoneos-arm.deb?raw=true).

Anyways, enjoy!
