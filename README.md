SnooScreens
=============

SnooScreens allows you to change your wallpaper based on the front page of the subreddit or mulitreddit of your choice. You simply pick a subreddit or multireddit and an activation method using Activator and you’re good to go! There are also options for allowing or blocking NSFW images, setting to the home screen, lock screen, or both, saving to the photo library, and using the top image post on a subreddit, or a random one from the front page (top 25).

There are 5 separate Activator listeners, so you can get wallpapers from different subreddits at different times or occasions. Each listener has its own independent settings, so one can set your lock screen to the top post of /r/spaceporn at 6:30 AM, save it to your library, and block NSFW images, while another could set your home screen to a random post from the front page of /r/wallpaper when you shake your phone, allowing NSFW images and not saving it to your photo library. And you can have any permutation of these settings with 5 different listeners.

While SnooScreens is a commercial tweak, it is still open source.

###TODO:

* Prevent duplicate photo saves (CFPreference Utils)
* Resize images
* Prevent downloading the same image (CFPreference Utils)
* Skip wallpaper option (some sort of timer to keep looking if you’re not happy. I want it to be unintrusive and let the user do nothing if they’re happy with the wallpaper)
